## About
muLinux was an Italian  lightweight floppy-based Linux distribution.
It is a miniature, but nearly full-featured distribution (i.e., version) of Linux that can fit on a single floppy disk and can turn almost any personal computer into a temporary but powerful Linux machine in a matter of minutes. It allows very old and obsolete computers (80386, 80486 and Pentium Pro hardware (dating from 1986 through 1998) to be used as basic intranet/Internet servers or text-based workstations with a UNIX-like operating system along with system repair, education, forensic analysis and what the developer called *proselytizing*. In 2004 reviewer Paul Zimmer wrote, "Although there are several other single-floppy Linux distributions, none can match muLinux's extensive and unique combination of useful features." The last version update was in 2004, when further development of this "linux-on-a-floppy" distribution ended.
